# Halloween-Coffin
A little scary toy.

Based on an idea from here:
https://www.az-delivery.de/blogs/azdelivery-blog-fur-arduino-und-raspberry-pi/halloween-2022-der-suessigkeitenwaechter

Software is based on a miniature board using ESP8266 which I developed myself.
Any other microcontroller would do, but my code might use some minor changes.

Some more information is at thingiverse, but I'd recommend to use STL from github:
