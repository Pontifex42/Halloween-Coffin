# Halloween-Coffin
A little scary toy.

Based on an idea from here:

Software is based on a miniature board using ESP8266 which I developed myself.
Any other microcontroller would do, but my code might use some minor changes.
To make your own board, here are schematics and Gerber files:

Not all components have to be populated, many parts are optional.

Some more information is at thingiverse, but I'd recommend to use STL from github:

Mp3 samples are for mp3 player like DFPlayer.
Some mp3 snippets are omitted due to legal reasons, I took them from a song "Nina Hagen - Auf'm Friedhof".
Feel free to place your own samples (< 10 seconds), the filename scheme is obvious.
